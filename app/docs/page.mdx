# Kinetic Kit

Kinetic Kit offers a collection of reusable components

## Vision

As a developer, I struggled to find practical, high-quality animated components suitable for real-world projects. Kinetic Kit was created to fill this gap, providing ready-to-use, customizable components that improve marketing websites and web applications.

### Easy to Use and customize

Each component has comprehensive examples and detailed documentation. You can use them directly or easily modify them to align with your custom UI kit, design system, or specific requirements.

### Built around Framer Motion

All components are built with Framer Motion to ensure a solid foundation and showcase the library's capabilities. Future plans include versions using CSS and Tailwind CSS only.

### Open source and community-driven

Kinetic Kit is open-source. Contributions are welcome to expand and improve the collection.
